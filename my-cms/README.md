## FireCMS starter template

Welcome to FireCMS!

This is a starter template for your next project. It includes the basic
configuration to get you started.

In order to run this project, you will need to create a Firebase project,
create a web app and copy the configuration to the `firebase-config.ts`.

Then simply run:

### Running the project

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Building the project

Make sure you update your `package.json` `build` script with the correct 
project name. Then run:

```bash
yarn build
```

> Note: this may not work if you have set up your Firebase hosting with 
> a custom config.
